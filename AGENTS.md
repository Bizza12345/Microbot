This repository uses a multi-branch workflow.
All changes should be merged into the `dev` branch.

Current focus: Enhance the mQuester addon so it can acquire quest items automatically via the Grand Exchange.

- Do **not** modify the RuneLite API or external plugin APIs.
- Network dependencies fail during compilation; prioritize logic correctness over building.
- Add verbose logging to help debug item acquisition logic.
